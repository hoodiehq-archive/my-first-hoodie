# Creating a new Hoodie App

## Installation

Please refer to the [install guides for OS X, Linux and Windows](http://hood.ie/#installation).

## Modules

To install a specific module, run (in your app's directory):

    $ hoodie install <name>

where `<name>` is one of the Hoodie Modules.

To uninstall use:

    $ hoodie uninstall <name>

## Troubleshooting

Make sure that local-tld got installed correctly

    $ NODE_PATH=`npm root -g`
    $ open $NODE_PATH/local-tld

Make sure that paths have been set correctly

    $ echo $NODE_PATH
    $ cat ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ie.hood.local-tld-service.plist

In some situations, you may need to manually update `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ie.hood.local-tld-service.plist` to correctly source your Node installation, particularly if you are using a Node version manager, such as `nvm`.

Check the output of `$ cat ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ie.hood.local-tld-service.plist` for the following:

```
<key>ProgramArguments</key>
<array>
    <string>should equal the output of `$ which node`</string>
    <string>should equal the output of `$ echo $NODE_PATH` + /local-tld/bin/local-tld-service</string>
</array>
```

If these values aren't correct, you'll need to open `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ie.hood.local-tld-service.plist` in a text editor and update the file with the aforementioned values.

If things do not work, try:

    $ launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ie.hood.local-tld-service.plist
    $ launchctl load -Fw ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ie.hood.local-tld-service.plist

If things STILL don't work, try that (but don't tell Jan) ((I saw this! â€” Jan))

    $ sudo $NODE_PATH/local-tld/bin/local-tld-troubleshoot

**Vhosts**

If you find Hoodie interfering with your vhosts, here's a temporary workaround:

To get your vhosts back: `$ sudo ipfw flush`

To get local-tld back: `$ npm install -g local-tld`

To find out which state you're in: `$ sudo ipfw list`
If this includes something like "00100 fwd 127.0.0.1,5999 tcp from any to me dst-port 80 in", local-tld is currently running and might be blocking your vhosts.

## Deploy to Nodejitsu

You need a Nodejitsu account and the `jitsu` tool installed.

Create a new hoodie app:

    $ hoodie new myapp

Start app locally:

    $ cd myapp
    $ hoodie start

Create a database:

    $ jitsu database create couch myapp

This prints out the URL for your database, something like:

    http://nodejitsudb123456789.iriscouch.com:5984

Go to:

    http://nodejitsudb123456789.iriscouch.com:5984/_utils

In the bottom right, click on "Fix This". Create a new user with the username `admin` and a password of your choice. Remember the password.

Create the Nodejitsu app.

    $ jitsu apps create

Set your database URL as an environment variable:

    $ jitsu env set COUCH_URL http://nodejitsudb1234567890.iriscouch.com:5984
    $ jitsu env set HOODIE_ADMIN_USER admin
    $ jitsu env set HOODIE_ADMIN_PASS <yourpassword>
    

`<yourpassword>` is the one you set up two steps ago.

Deploy!

    $ jitsu deploy

(wait a minute)

Go to: `http://myapp.jit.su`

Boom.


## Deploy dreamcode tl;dr

    $ hoodie new myapp
