# This folder is temporary

Hoodie creates a virtual path `/hoodie/bundle.js` from where you can load the
Hoodie client specific to your app, which makes this folder obsolete.

We added the `hoodie` folder temporarily to `my-first-hoodie` to make it simpler
to contribute to the frontend assets, as it allows to work on the HTML / CSS /
JS code and test by opening the index.html file right in your browser, without
the need to start the hoodie server
